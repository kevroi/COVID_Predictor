# COVID-19 Outcome Predictor

## Overview
This work implements and deploys three predictive machine learning models and evaluates their performances in predicting the final outcome of a positive COVID-19 case. All three models are trained on data from University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ([this](https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019) is their repo).

Such models are crucial for both their capabalities of isolating and protecting vulnerable groups, as well as their potential generalisations to future diseases, epidemics and pandemics.

The main theory, results, figures and citations for this model can be found in the accompanied [report](Report.pdf).
